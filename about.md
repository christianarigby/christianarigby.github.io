# About Christiana Rigby

Christiana&rsquo;s Howard County roots run deep and the vision of Jim Rouse has had a profound influence on her principles and values. She was born and raised in District 3, in the Columbia village of Kings Contrivance. Christiana attended HCPSS public schools, is a graduate of Hammond High School and mom to two future golden bears.

After graduating from UMBC, Arizona Public Interest Research Group (Arizona PIRG) recruited Christiana to work as a community organizer. There she honed her skills leading consumer protection initiatives, strengthening environmental regulations, and fighting to safeguard employment opportunities for the LGBTQ community. Enhancing community is at the heart of all she does &mdash; be it bringing together businesses and nonprofits to aide neighbors in need, inspiring environmental action, and even empowering breast cancer survivors.

As vice-chair of the Kings Contrivance Village Board, Christiana knows the concerns and issues directly affecting our community. In addition, Christiana proudly serves on the Economic Resource Allocation Committee of the Howard County Board to Promote Self Sufficiency, where she works with a dedicated team to obtain federal funding to improve economic stability and reduce poverty in the County. Christiana also serves on the board of Howard EcoWorks organizing environmental improvement and workforce development programs for a more sustainable and healthier Howard County.

Christiana has her finger on the pulse of our neighborhoods and is deeply committed to creating change on issues important to our community.

__Join Christiana to create opportunity for all in Howard County.__
