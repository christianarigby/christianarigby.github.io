# Issues

## Education
Christiana is a proud HCPSS graduate and believes our school system must shine brighter as a beacon for Howard County.  Our schools are the number one reason people choose to live in our community. Transparent and accountable leadership is needed, as is a positive and inclusive relationship between the council, the school system, and parents. We must fully support all our teachers and students. With two children of her own, she understands and empathizes with the issues parents are facing.

## Economic Development
Christiana champions responsible economic development where the benefits extend to many residents instead of a chosen few. Public participation and inclusion must be a priority for an open process. She will bring enthusiasm, energy, and dedication that is needed for Route 1 revitalization.

## Safer Neighborhoods
Our first responders must be fully supported in their quest to aid our neighbors in their time of need. It is critical that we address the issues of crime, addiction, and violence that plague our communities. All our residents should feel safe in our community.

## Environment
As a former employee for the US Fish and Wildlife service Christiana takes deep pride in our natural resources. We must carefully manage the remaining natural areas we have with an eye to the future.
